# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses comprehensive code quality issues in the Claude-to-Azure OpenAI proxy project, including ESLint violations, TypeScript strict mode compliance, test failures, and security vulnerabilities. The goal is to achieve 100% compliance with the project's strict coding standards while maintaining functionality and security.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: ESLint Compliance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all code to pass ESLint checks without errors or warnings, so that the codebase maintains consistent quality and follows security best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `pnpm lint` THEN the system SHALL return zero errors and zero warnings
2. WHEN code uses equality operators THEN the system SHALL use strict equality (`===`, `!==`) instead of loose equality (`==`, `!=`)
3. WHEN code handles nullable values THEN the system SHALL explicitly check for null/undefined cases using proper type guards
4. WHEN code uses logical operators THEN the system SHALL prefer nullish coalescing (`??`) over logical OR (`||`) for null/undefined checks
5. WHEN function parameters are used THEN the system SHALL mark them as readonly when they are not modified
6. WHEN code accesses object properties dynamically THEN the system SHALL use safe property access patterns to prevent object injection
7. WHEN code uses conditional expressions THEN the system SHALL ensure boolean expressions are explicit and type-safe
8. WHEN unused variables or imports exist THEN the system SHALL remove them or mark them as intentionally unused
9. WHEN async functions are defined THEN the system SHALL contain at least one await expression or be marked appropriately
10. WHEN code uses any type THEN the system SHALL replace it with proper type definitions or unknown with type guards

### Requirement 2: TypeScript Strict Mode Compliance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all TypeScript code to comply with strict mode settings, so that type safety is maximized and runtime errors are minimized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `pnpm type-check` THEN the system SHALL return zero TypeScript errors
2. WHEN handling external API responses THEN the system SHALL use proper type guards instead of any types
3. WHEN defining function signatures THEN the system SHALL include explicit return types
4. WHEN working with optional properties THEN the system SHALL handle undefined cases explicitly
5. WHEN using object destructuring THEN the system SHALL ensure all properties exist before access
6. WHEN calling external functions THEN the system SHALL ensure argument types match parameter types exactly
7. WHEN returning values from functions THEN the system SHALL ensure return types match declared types
8. WHEN using array methods THEN the system SHALL handle potential undefined/null values in predicates

### Requirement 3: Test Suite Reliability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all tests to pass consistently, so that I can trust the test suite to catch regressions and validate functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `pnpm test` THEN the system SHALL pass all tests without failures
2. WHEN tests mock external dependencies THEN the system SHALL properly configure and reset mocks between tests
3. WHEN tests expect specific HTTP status codes THEN the system SHALL return the correct status codes
4. WHEN tests validate error responses THEN the system SHALL return properly formatted error objects
5. WHEN tests check API responses THEN the system SHALL match expected response formats exactly
6. WHEN tests validate security measures THEN the system SHALL properly sanitize sensitive information
7. WHEN tests check concurrent operations THEN the system SHALL handle race conditions appropriately
8. WHEN tests validate streaming functionality THEN the system SHALL properly handle stream events and errors
9. WHEN tests check format detection THEN the system SHALL correctly identify request/response formats
10. WHEN tests validate reasoning effort THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate reasoning levels based on context

### Requirement 4: Security Vulnerability Remediation

**User Story:** As a security-conscious developer, I want all security vulnerabilities to be resolved, so that the application is protected against common attack vectors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code accesses object properties dynamically THEN the system SHALL validate property names to prevent object injection
2. WHEN code handles user input THEN the system SHALL sanitize and validate all inputs
3. WHEN error messages are returned THEN the system SHALL not expose sensitive information like API keys or internal URLs
4. WHEN handling file uploads or dynamic content THEN the system SHALL prevent script injection attacks
5. WHEN using eval-like functions THEN the system SHALL avoid them or use safe alternatives
6. WHEN processing external data THEN the system SHALL validate data types and structures before use
7. WHEN logging information THEN the system SHALL redact sensitive data from logs
8. WHEN handling authentication THEN the system SHALL properly validate and sanitize credentials

### Requirement 5: Memory Management and Resource Cleanup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to properly manage memory and resources, so that it doesn't suffer from memory leaks or resource exhaustion under load.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating event listeners THEN the system SHALL properly remove them when no longer needed
2. WHEN using timers or intervals THEN the system SHALL clear them in cleanup functions
3. WHEN handling streams THEN the system SHALL properly close and cleanup stream resources
4. WHEN caching data THEN the system SHALL use WeakMap/WeakSet to allow garbage collection
5. WHEN creating temporary objects THEN the system SHALL ensure they can be garbage collected
6. WHEN handling large payloads THEN the system SHALL use streaming to avoid memory accumulation
7. WHEN running long operations THEN the system SHALL monitor and limit memory usage
8. WHEN tests complete THEN the system SHALL cleanup all resources to prevent test interference

### Requirement 6: Concurrency and Multi-User Safety

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to handle multiple concurrent users safely, so that data doesn't leak between requests and performance remains stable under load.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing concurrent requests THEN the system SHALL isolate request data to prevent cross-contamination
2. WHEN accessing shared resources THEN the system SHALL use thread-safe patterns
3. WHEN handling async operations THEN the system SHALL prevent race conditions
4. WHEN managing connections THEN the system SHALL use connection pooling efficiently
5. WHEN under high load THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting per user
6. WHEN external services fail THEN the system SHALL use circuit breaker patterns
7. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL isolate them to prevent cascading failures
8. WHEN tracking requests THEN the system SHALL maintain correlation IDs for concurrent operations

### Requirement 7: Code Maintainability Enhancement

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the codebase to follow consistent patterns and best practices, so that it's easy to maintain and extend.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining interfaces and types THEN the system SHALL use readonly properties where appropriate
2. WHEN handling errors THEN the system SHALL use consistent error handling patterns across all modules
3. WHEN writing functions THEN the system SHALL keep them focused on single responsibilities
4. WHEN using external libraries THEN the system SHALL properly type their usage
5. WHEN creating utility functions THEN the system SHALL make them pure and testable
6. WHEN handling asynchronous operations THEN the system SHALL use proper error handling and cleanup
7. WHEN defining constants THEN the system SHALL use appropriate naming conventions and immutable structures
8. WHEN writing comments THEN the system SHALL provide clear documentation for complex logic

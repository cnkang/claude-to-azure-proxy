# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature migrates the Claude-to-Azure OpenAI proxy from using the Chat Completions API to the Responses API to fully leverage GPT-5-Codex's advanced capabilities including enhanced reasoning, structured outputs, tool usage, and conversation management. This migration will unlock the model's full potential for coding assistance across multiple development environments including Android Studio, VS Code, and various programming languages (Python, Java, Spring Cloud, shell scripts, React, Vue, TypeScript) while maintaining compatibility with Claude Code CLI and existing integrations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using various development environments (Android Studio, VS Code, Claude Code CLI, or other compatible clients) with Azure OpenAI, I want the proxy to use the Responses API so that I can benefit from GPT-5-Codex's enhanced reasoning capabilities for complex coding tasks across different programming languages and frameworks.

#### Acceptance Criteria
